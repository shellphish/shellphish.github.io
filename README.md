# shellphish.github.io
Shellphish web site currently a repo for the static HTML

The previous website was done with hugo and housed internally, 
the url was: https://git.seclab.cs.ucsb.edu/shellphish/shellphish.net 

(don't expect to find it here, the path is just relevant for historical purposes)

Moving the website here solves the problem of expiring certificates.
