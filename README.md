# shellphish.github.io
Shellphish web site currently a repo for the static HTML

The previous website was done with hugo and housed internally, 
https://git.seclab.cs.ucsb.edu/shellphish/shellphish.net

Moving the website here solves the problem of expiring certificates.


## Next steps 
Move the Hugo version (with saagarjha's pull request) into a GitHub CI/CD workflow.
